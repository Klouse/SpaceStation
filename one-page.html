			<h1>Space Station</h1>
			
			<section>
				<h2>Genre</h2>
				<p>Simulation, Sci-Fi</p>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h2>Story</h2>
				<p>There is no story behind our space adveture, except that you are a space cadet exploring a space station. </p>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h2>Aesthetics</h2>
				<p>The Sim is made up of 3D models, some created in Maya and some just textured shapes using three.js </p>
				<h3>Sounds</h3>
				<p>We will have constant background music playing no matter where you are in the map. There will be a different song for inside and outside the station. When inside there will also be various electronic sounds that play randomly. When a door is opened, a typical "woosh" sound will be heard. The shuttle will have a rocket sound when you boost.</p>
			</section>

				<h2>Gameplay</h2>
				<h3>Mechanics</h3>
				<p>We have two main mechanics for this simulation, walking/floating around the inside the space station and flying the space shuttle outside the station. Inside the station there are doors to open that seperate the two halves of the station. To open a door, approach it and press E (a screen tip is displayed). Outside in the space shuttle you can fly around in space and re-dock to re-enter the station.</p>
		
				
				<h3>Control</h3>
				<p>Inside the space station you used WASD to walk around the inside of the station. Outside the station you use W for thrust forward, S to slow down, A for roll left D for roll right, Mouse Up for pitch up, and Mouse Down for pitch down.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>WASD</li>
					<li>Mouse to look</li>
				</ul>
