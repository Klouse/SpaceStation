			<h1>Space Station</h1>
			
			<section>
				<h2>Genre</h2>
				<p>Simulation, Sci-Fi</p>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h2>Story</h2>
				<p>There is no story behind our space adveture, except that you are a space cadet exploring the solar system. </p>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h2>Aesthetics</h2>
				<p>The Sim is made up of 3D models, some created in Maya and some just textured shapes using three.js. The camera is free to move and is controlled by the user, you may not exit the skybox however.

				</p>
				<h3>Sounds</h3>
				<p>We have a constant background sound that plays on the load of the page. The music was found for free on <a href ="http://www.nosoapradio.us/">here</a> There is also a select "blip" sound that is played when you click on any planet. Jake created this sound using <a href ="http://www.bfxr.net/">BFXR</a></p>

				<h2>Mechanics and Controls</h2>
				<p>The main mechanic is using the mose to look around. You may left click to zoom in, and right click to zoom out. When you click on a planet the camera zooms into see the planet up close, some info is also displayed on the right hand side. There are comets that fly around the screen but they are very hard to see.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>WASD</li>
					<li>Mouse to look</li>
				</ul>
		
				
				<h3>3D models</h3>
				<p>There is one custom model we used to make the space station floating around the Earth. Each of the planets are made using spheres and the skybox is a giant cube.

				<h3>Jake Russell</h3>
				<p>Wrote some of the base code and Created all visuals, minus the comets, and the custom models. Jake implemented the skybox, music, sound effect.</p>
